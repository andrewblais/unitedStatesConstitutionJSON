I've made an effort to apply consistent formatting across the nested dictionaries. For instance, some key: VALUES are multiple elements in a list, while some have only one element. To maintain consistency that single key: VALUE element is in a list with the key 'SINGLESECTION' so the it can be retrieved the same way.
