I've made an effort to apply consistent formatting across the nested dictionaries. For instance, some sections have multiple elements thus utilizing a list aptly, while some have only one element -- but to maintain consistency that single element is in a list titled 'SINGLESECTION' so the it can be retrieved the same way.
